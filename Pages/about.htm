<p style="color:grey; padding-right:500pt;">The TGIF is the organising body of the FIFA with responsibility for the competition, its Rule Book and the centralised broadcast and other commercial rights.</p>
<p style="padding-right:500pt;">However, we do not operate in isolation, instead we work proactively and constructively with our Member Teams and the other football authorities to improve the quality of football across the world.
Here is who we work with:</p>
<h2 style="color:blue;">The Team Members of TGIF</h2>
<p style="padding-right:500pt;">The TGIF is a private company in coalition with its 16 Member Clubs who make up the League at any one time.
Each individual club is independent: working within the rules of football, as defined by the TGIF, Uefa and Fifa.</p>
<p style="padding-right:500pt;">Each of the 16 teams is a Shareholder in the TGIF.
Consultation is at the heart of the TGIF and Shareholder meetings are the ultimate decision-making forum for TGIF policy and are held at regular intervals during the course of the season.</p>
<p style="padding-right:500pt;">Members have the opportunity to propose new rules or amendments at the Shareholder meeting.
Each Member Team is entitled to one vote and all rule changes and major commercial contracts require the support of a two thirds vote, or 10 teams, to be agreed.</p>
<p style="padding-right:500pt;">The TGIF Rule Book serves as a contract between the League, the Member Teams and one another, defining the structure and running of the competition.</p>
<p style="padding-right:500pt;">Any serious breach of the Rule Book results in an independent three-person tribunal sitting to hear the case, ascertain guilt and set the punishment, which can range from fines to points deductions and, in extreme cases, expulsion from the competition.</p>
