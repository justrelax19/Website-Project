<h2>UEFA</h2>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) is a competition organiser and is responsible for the organisation and regulation of cross-border football in Europe. It also organises the European Championships for national associations every four years.</p>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">UEFA is primarily known for its European club competitions, the Champions League and Europa League, in which Premier League clubs play an active part in delivering broadcast audiences and attracting commercial revenue for UEFA.</p>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">The Premier League is one of the top performing leagues in European football and has for been in the top three of the UEFA Association Coefficient table for a number of years. In practical terms it means the Premier League gets four teams into the UEFA Champions League and another three into the Europa League.</p>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">The representative structures for UEFA are mainly association-based with The FA representing English football on numerous committees. However, recent changes at UEFA have seen greater club involvement through the European Club Association, of which the Premier League has five Ordinary Members and five Associated Members. The European Professional Football Leagues, which represents 30 leagues across Europe, has also gained some representation at UEFA level.</p>
<h2>FIFA</h2>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">Fifa (Federation of International Football Associations) is football’s world governing body and is primarily known for organising the Fifa World Cup every four years. However, its biggest responsibility is for the regulation, promotion and development of football at international level.</p>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">All football played at any official level must abide by the Laws of the Game, as set by Fifa. So, everything from the Offside Law to International Call-ups is decided by the Zurich-based world governing body. </p>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">Fifa’s rules and regulations are decided by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) and reviewed on an annual basis. The IFAB consists of four representatives of Fifa and one each from the national associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p style="padding-right:700pt;">Fifa sets the international fixture calendar which, along with European and domestic cup dates, takes precedence over domestic league football. This means Fifa and UEFA dates are the first in the fixture calendar, followed by The FA Cup and then the League Cup. Only after those dates have been fixed can the Premier League fixture list be compiled.</p>
