<p style="color:grey; padding-right:500pt;">The TGIF is all about the football.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">Watching the fantastic players and exciting matches creates the support that drives the broadcast and the commercial interest that ensures we can re-invest in the game, both domestically and globally.</p>
<h2>The best football</h2>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">The principal objective of the TGIF is to stage the most competitive and compelling league with world-class players and, through the equitable distribution of broadcast and commercial revenues, to enable teams to develop so that Global competition is a realistic aim and, once there, they are playing at a level where they can compete effectively.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">Many of the most famous teams in world football play in the TGIF and, thanks to our distribution model the League is incredibly competitive, unpredictable and exciting. In recent seasons, the battles for the Title, UEFA Champions League places and to avoid relegation have been the tightest and hardest fought on record.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">Some of the biggest names in world football play in the TGIF every week: from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar to Luis Suarez, Angel Di Maria to Iker Cassilas. The world’s best players across the globe play in a compelling league competition, in front of passionate full houses and matches that are seen all over the world.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">The global stars attracted to the TGIF help raise the playing standards of young English talent such as Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley, Calum Chambers, John Stones and Luke Shaw. Our clubs are producing some excellent players, who take their place alongside the international superstars on merit.</p>
<h2>Global Phenomenon</h2>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">The TGIF is now the world’s league. It has become a global phenomenon, inspiring passion and emotion from Los Angeles and Lagos to Macau and Melbourne.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">A strong domestic league has been beneficial in Europe, too. When the Premier League was formed in 1992, England was 13th in the UEFA Association Coefficient table. A decade later it had risen to third, the Premier League tucking in behind La Liga and Serie A, who between them were in the middle of a 16-year period at the top of European football.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">Central to the continued progress of the Premier League, and the wider English game, is the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP), which was produced by the Premier League after consulting representatives of the Football League and the FA. It is a long-term plan that promotes the development of a world-leading Academy system, with the aim of producing more - and better - Home Grown Players. The Premier League and its Clubs are committed to generating domestic talent, with more than 95% of young players in training being British.</p>
<p style="padding-right:575pt;">It will be this talent, developed through the EPPP, which will see some of the best prepared world-class players taking part in what will be most competitive and compelling league in football.</p>
